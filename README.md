# NgFoundry

Interactive 2D/3D library for designed for the collaborative construction of semantically correct diagrams and drawings.

Great visualization tools exist in open source for charting and diagraming (d3.js, three.js). ngFoundry is a programmatic approach to creating diagram with a focus on preserving the semantics of the model to be visualized. This is enforced during user interaction and programmatic queries. 

A Metadata Always approach allows for storage of design intent within executable code. Metadata can be transferred between computers in real time to synchronize the actions of multiple systems

ngFoundry is a TypeScript/Angular implementation. The library is a series of well factored JavaScript classes engineered to represent components of semantic models of real worlds systems using a common vocabulary. Components, Attributes, Relationships, Notifications and Instances are all first class objects in ngFoundry, along with the supporting knowledge structures like Concepts, Properties and Conditional Assemblies.

ngFoundry mashes together computer science ideas from Object Oriented, programming, Functional programming, the Actor model, and reactive programming to create it approach to modeling real world system.  



1.	Designed for Collaboration
2.	Designed for Semantic interaction and enforcement
3.	Designed for the Web and Desktop (cross-platform) 
4.	Lessons learned from previous implementations

# Instructions for building and running ngFoundry yourself

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
